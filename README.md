# Patient Charges
 This program creates 3 random patients and displays their unique procedures, practitioners, and dates for each and displays
 them with their respective costs.

The Patient.py file creates a class with the potential data for each randomized patient stored in lists. The simplifiedPatientCharges program then takes a random procedure and assigns it to
the Patient object and calculates a cost along with the doctor doing the procedure. The main()
function neatly presents 3 randomized patients with different procedures and the doctor performing
the surgery based on the the amount of patients generated.
